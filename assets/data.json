Before that, the last time I drew anything was probably 10 years ago. Of course, I still have a long way to go to reach your level, but you inspire me to try!\nAnyway, other than the drawing, I also organized this birthday project. I hope you love it as much as I do! None of this would have been possible without the help and creativity of your Sanallites. So many of them participated in drawing or writing something heartfelt for you; it even made *me* emotional while putting this website together.\nSana, I hope you see the love that all your fans have for you; it's as vast as Jupiter, burns hotter than the sun, and will endure longer than the heat death of the universe. I'm so proud of what you've accomplished in Hololive already, and I can't wait to continue this journey with you, through all the hardships and the good times— no matter what form it takes. To infinity and beyond!\n\nI'm glad you're around. Happy birthday.\n\nWith Love,\nJoel Z",

Some of these instances involve interfering with some goody two-shoe kids called the Delightful Children from Down the Lane. These Delightful Children have numerous birthday cakes per year and never share with anyone but themselves. In one of the episodes, an adult by the name of Father was able to make the Delightful Children's birthday cake into a space station as a parody to Star Wars or any similar sci-fi genre scenario. This roughly made Microsoft Paint image depicts the cake in orbit like that of the cartoon mentioned. I doubt it would be BEEG enough without your limiter, but it's the thought that counts.
